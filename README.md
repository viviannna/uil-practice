Solutions to UIL Computer Science Hands On Examples: 
If you wanted to be added as a collaborator, send your GitHub account to Vivianna Lieu. The folders should have a pdf/word doc that has the prompts, the data input files,
and if they've been solved, the solution java file.

TO UPLOAD:
- you can either just upload the folders directly (make sure to upload folders NOT files and that they're named with the year of competition, date, and level) OR
- you can clone them + push changes (a little harder and not necessary since we're not collaborating)
